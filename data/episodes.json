To the ones who won't be able to say their final good-byes. To the ones who can't hug each other for the last time. To the ones who were waiting to dress up for graduation/farewell to take photos with their squads.This one goes out to each every brave soul of Batch of 2020. We respect what you are going through and thank you for everything you have taught us.",
